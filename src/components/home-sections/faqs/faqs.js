                        Yes, your vehicle will be covered by the carrierâ€™s cargo insurance. Additionally, we have our
                        own
                        contingent cargo insurance, which protects you for up to $250,000 should the truckers policy

                        After an order is placed, we search our car carrier network to find a trucker to transport your
                        vehicle. We will assign the best one available and give you an estimated pickup time. The
                        trucker will call you to confirm the details ahead of schedule.

                    <p>
                        When you place an order, you will receive an estimated transit time for your shipment. This will
                        give you a window for when your car will be delivered. Transit times depend on moving distance.
                        With each delivery being unique, it is possible that your car would be delivered faster than the
                        estimated transit time provided.

                        While we cannot guarantee a pickup or delivery date, we recommend booking with as much advance

                        have outstanding customer service and delivery records. In the unlikely event that your vehicle
