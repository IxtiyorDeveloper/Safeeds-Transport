                <li> Customer may cancel an Order at any time at no cost or cancellation fees as long as the Order has
                    not yet been accepted by a Carrier. If the Order is canceled for any reason after a Carrier accepts
                    the Order, such reasons including but not limited to Customer canceling an Order, Montway canceling
                    an Order due to the Customer’s breach of these TERMS or if the Carrier is denied pick up of the
                    Shipment for any reason when the Carrier arrives at the Point of Origin, then the Customer agrees to
                    pay a minimum of one hundred and ninety nine dollars ($199.00) in cancellation fees as Montway’s
                    services have been rendered at that point. Customer understands and accepts that the Customer may be
                    subject to additional cancellation fees including but not limited to a dry run fee imposed by a
                    Carrier and other vendors contracted to fulfill Customer’s Order.
                </li>
                <li> Customer is entitled to a refund for only the unfulfilled portion of the services. If Additional
                    Services were paid for but not rendered for any reason and the Shipment was delivered, the sole
                    remedy for the Customer shall be a refund for the unfulfilled portion of the Additional Services
                    fees.
                </li>
                <li> Cancellation of an Order by Customer must be submitted in writing via email sent to
