                    .Once a carrier is assigned to transport vehicle(s), Client will be given the projected dates of
                    pickup and
                    delivery as well as the Carrier name and direct phone number. Any dates given by Safeeds Transport
                    Inc
                    (STI) are Carrier's computations only and are provided solely to assist the Client and Carrier in
                    the
                    arrangement of their schedules. Dates provided for pick up or delivery are never guaranteed, as
                    certain
                    conditions can alter a Carrier's schedule ( i.e. weather and road conditions, scheduling or
                    mechanical
                    issues, a late customer, etc.). Thus, Client may never hold STI liable for costs incurred as the
                    result of any
                    delays, including (but not limited to) any car rental fees or accommodation fees for Client.
                </li>
                <li>Vehicles must be tendered to carrier in good running condition with no more than a half tank of fuel.
                    Carrier will not be liable for damage caused by leaking fluids, freezing, exhaust systems, or antennas not
                    tied down. Any claim for loss or damage must be noted and signed on condition report at time of
                    delivery.

                <li>
                    INOP ( inoperable ) vehicles must roll, steer and brake. If vehicle does not meet all three of these
                    conditions, additional fees may apply. Vehicles that become non-operational during shipment, for any
                    reason, will be subject to an additional, industry standard, non-operational fee of One Hundred and Fifty
                    Dollars ($150.00). If vehicle is INOP and Carrier cannot physically reach the pick up or delivery location, a
                    local tow truck may be used to assist in the service at the expense of Client. Also, any Client shipping
                    INOP vehicle(s) may be required to help load or unload at Carrier's discretion.

                    The total price for the transportation is factored using numerous pieces of information including (but
                    not limited to) the size and/or weight of the vehicle(s). Misrepresentation to STI of vehicle(s) size,
                    weight and/or any modifications may result in additional fees and/or cancelation of the order. Booking
                    fees are never refunded in orders canceled due to misrepresentation of vehicle(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the event that Carrier is unable to safely access the pickup or delivery addresses given by Client
                    (due to, but not limited to: entrance restrictions, low hanging branches, and/or narrow streets), Client
                    agrees to meet Carrier at a nearby location in order for Carrier to safely perform his service. Inability to
                    meet Carrier at pick up and/or delivery may result in additional fees.

                <li>
                    Customer may cancel an Order at any time at no cost or cancellation fees as long as the Order has not
                    yet been accepted by a Carrier. If the Order is canceled for any reason after a Carrier accepts the Order,
                    such reasons including but not limited to Customer canceling an Order, STI canceling an Order due to
                    the Customer’s breach of these TERMS or if the Carrier is denied pick up of the Shipment for any reason
                    when the Carrier arrives at the Point of Origin, then the Customer agrees to pay a minimum of one
                    hundred dollars ($200) in cancellation fees as STI's services have been rendered at that point.

                    tornadoes and earthquakes) or objects flying from the road or sky during transport. Shippers should
                    maintain their own insurance for these reasons. Enclosed transport is available at a higher price if
                    necessary to ensure the condition of the vehicle.

                    to Carrier’s lien for transportation charges until Customer pays in full the outstanding balance. Any and
                    all storage and redelivery charges will be the responsibility of Customer and Customer agrees that
